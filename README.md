Objective : You work for Spark Funds, an asset management company. Spark Funds wants to make investments in a few companies. The CEO of Spark Funds wants to understand the global trends in investments so that she can take the investment decisions effectively.

Business and Data Understanding : Spark Funds has two minor constraints for investments:

It wants to invest between 5 to 15 million USD per round of investment

It wants to invest only in English-speaking countries because of the ease of communication with the companies it would invest in. For the analysis, consider a country to be English speaking only if English is one of the official languages in that country

Business objective: The objective is to identify the best sectors, countries, and a suitable investment type for making investments. The overall strategy is to invest where others are investing, implying that the 'best' sectors and countries are the ones 'where most investors are investing'. (Spark Funds wants to invest where most other investors are investing. This pattern is often observed among early stage startup investors.)
